    Information Collection and Use
  </h2>


<div class="post-text " id="">
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
When you register for our Services, you provide personal data about yourself that may include your name, email address, phone number, tax ID number, physical address, and other information that can directly identify you individually (collectively, “Personal Information”). If the Services include rights for multiple users (“Users”), we may collect Personal Information that they provide as well.</p>
<p>We also collect Personal Information if you provide it to us to receive newsletters or when requesting support, and we share that with our newsletter and customer support providers. Some of the data we collect is not Personal Information on its own, such as IP address or exact latitude and longitude coordinates, but where we can associate that information with other personal data (like your name or email address), we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>We use Personal Information only to provide the Services to you and for the purposes for which you’ve provided it, such as to receive support or newsletters, and to enable your use of the App and the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous Data</strong></p>
<p>The Site, the Services and the App also collect anonymous information (collectively, “Anonymous Data”) which includes: (i) information about the features of the Site, the Services and/or the Apps that you’ve used and the times when you’ve used them, along with cookie information (described below), (ii) information available from identifiers scanned with the App, the time of scans, and the number of times you use the App; and (iii) device information, such as device type, device identifiers (if available), and general location information (e.g. city or country), and (iv) general information such as language settings, operating system type; page views, the number of times the Site is visited, IP address, browser type and App version number. We may use and share Anonymous Data for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Content</strong></p>
<p>If you use our Services, you or your Users may provide, and we may collect, information as agreed upon between you and Scantrust in an agreement. Ownership and use of such information is as set forth in such agreement (each a “Platform Agreement”).</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Tracking</strong></p>
<p>To provide you with a better experience, we may store information about you and/or Users in a cookie (a small file that is sent by our web server to a device being used to access or use the Services), which we can access when you or the relevant User makes return visits to the Site or our Services, or uses the App. Storing cookies is a practice where a service needs to remember its users’ preferences, and we use cookies to keep track of our users’ choices and to distinguish them from other users of Our services. It helps provide users with a better experience. These cookies are valid for 1 week.</p>
<p>Please note third parties (e.g. providers of external services like web traffic analysis) may use cookies over which we have no control. If you would like to delete any cookies that are already on a device, you need to locate the file or directory that the cookies are stored in and take the required action. If you want to block them, click “Help” in the browser menu on the relevant device to find out how to do this. Further information about deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.aboutcookies.org or at www.youronlinechoices.com.</p>
<p>We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics, Crazy Egg, Sentry, Hubspot, and Fabric (“Analytics Tools”), which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze about use of the Services and App and report on activities and trends. We use that information to collect Anonymous Data, which we use as provided above. That information is also used by the Analytics Tools providers according to their privacy policies. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
<p>You can learn about Hubspot’s practices, which includes non-anonymous tracking, by visiting https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy and <a href="https://legal.hubspot.com/cookie-policy">https://legal.hubspot.com/cookie-policy</a> and you can remove their tracking cookies by visiting https://legal.hubspot.com/cookie-policy#remove-cookies</p>
<p>You can learn about Crazy Egg and what they do at crazyegg.com. Crazy Egg has explicitly stated to Scantrust that it does not collect information from websites for any advertising purposes, nor do they collect any personally identifiable information via our site. Also, if you wish to opt out of cookies related to Crazy egg, you may do so.<br>
